I’m an international speaker, currently looking for speaking gigs for late-2019/2020.

I mostly speak on Web Performance, React, Redux and the JAMstack.

### Mentoring

I believe that speaking at meetups and conferences is a very formative experience, a perfect occasion to make friends and have meaningful discussions with people throughout the community.

However, securing a talk at a meetup or a conference can be way harder for people in under-represented and marginalized communities.

If you feel like this applies to you, I would gladly help you on securing your next talk (help writing your proposal, rehearsing…). Just contact me (links are in the menu) and we’ll figure out how to best make it happen!
