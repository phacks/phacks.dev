Iâ€™m a French Fullstack developer & Web Performance Evangelist at [Theodo](https://www.theodo.fr) based in Paris.

I am the co-organizer of the [WeLoveSpeed conference](https://welovespeed.com), the [JAMstack.paris Meetup](https://jamstack.paris) and a regular [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) contributor.

I am passionate about how tools and frameworks can make it easy and enjoyable for developers to build performant web apps.
