Iâ€™m a French Fullstack developer at [Orbit](https://orbit.love) (previously at [Theodo](https://www.theodo.fr)) based in Paris.

I am the co-organizer of the [WeLoveSpeed conference](https://welovespeed.com), the [JAMstack.paris Meetup](https://jamstack.paris) and a regular [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) contributor.

I am passionate about how tools and frameworks can make it easy and enjoyable for developers to build performant web apps.
