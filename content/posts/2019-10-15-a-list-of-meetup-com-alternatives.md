  Meetup.com announced it’s changing its business model, which will take a toll
  on Meetup organizers and attendees. Here’s a list of alternatives to consider
  for meetup organizers.

[Meetup.com](https://meetup.com) [just announced](https://www.meetup.com/lp/paymentchanges) that they are changing their business model, and will be imposing a $2 fee on attendees for each event. This is presumably a combined consequence of [WeWork acquiring Meetup](https://www.wework.com/newsroom/posts/wework-x-meetup) in 2017 and the [failed WeWork IPO](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wework-ipo-adam-neumann-business-model-valuation-2019-9-1028530754) earlier this year.

The new payment system will work as follows:

* Organizers will pay $2/month, a little less than what they pay today to be able to organize events;
* Attendees will pay $2/event, which is a **huge** change as meetups have mostly been free for attendees for many years.

As the co-organizer of the [JAMStack Paris](https://jamstack.paris), I am deeply concerned about this new model. I fear that people in the parisian JAMstack community, that I love to meet and have meaningful discussions with, may not want to pay to attend a previously free event. The _quality_ of the meetup (be it food, drinks, location) will not increase as a result of the new payment system, as us organizers will pocket exactly zero dollars from the Meetup fees.

In addition, Meetup-goers usually attend several events in a single month, meaning that the $2 fee may add up to a considerable expense.

For those reasons, I’m considering alternatives to Meetup.com for our meetup (_should it still be called like that?_). I’ll be compiling, and updating, a list of said alternatives in this article, in the hope that it may help other organizers pick up a new, better platform, to keep doing what we love.

As Meetup.com has reached a position of near-monopoly on meetups, its critical size and network effect is its main strength—and no alternative today can boast about such an active user base, at least here in France. In the following list, I’ll only focus on their features and business model. The main features I am ([and others are](https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo/status/1183842899450105856)) looking for are RSVPs (to have an estimate of the number of attendees), event pages (to share on social media) and mailing lists (to send important updates).
