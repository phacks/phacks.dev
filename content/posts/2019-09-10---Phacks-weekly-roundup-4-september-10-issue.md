## Articles

**James K Nelson ‚Äî [How can I use CSS-in-JS securely?](https://reactarmory.com/answers/how-can-i-use-css-in-js-securely)**<br />
CSS-in-JS libraries took over the React ecosystem by storm. The flexibility and practicality of using tools like [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) or [Glamorous](https://glamorous.rocks/) for managing the styles of React components is now a given. Although, [as a wise man once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5d6rTQcU2U&feature=youtu.be), ‚ÄúWith great power come great responsibilities‚Äù: CSS-in-JS comes with its lot of potential security flaws. So read on, and don‚Äôt forget to _never trust user input_.

**Tobias Koppers ‚Äî [Advanced Frontend Optimization (with Webpack)](http://sokra.github.io/slides/frontend-optimize/)**<br />
Although not a proper article, this impressive slide deck is a gold mine for fine-tuning Webpack configurations for performance. Tree shaking, Code Splitting, inlining, Server Side Rendering, you name it, it‚Äôs all there!

**Henrik Joreteg ‚Äî [Betting on the Web](https://joreteg.com/blog/betting-on-the-web)**<br />

One of the dev in the team reflects on the Web as a future-proof platform, and how PWAs will (possibly) become the new go-to platform, leaving native apps behind. Interesting and optimistic piece about what what the future of the Web (and IOT, and mobile) may well be!

**David Robinson ‚Äî [The Incredible Growth of Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/)**<br />
Stack Overflow reflects on the incredible growth of Python, based on their (tremendous) data. As a developer, it‚Äôs always interesting to have a look at global trends on languages or frameworks.
