## Articles

**Umar Hansa ‚Äî [Developer Tips](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/#archive)**<br />
More than 150 tips to master the Chrome Dev Tools! I personally had no idea you could have CSS coverage, Atom-style Cmd+Shift+P prompt or a built-in screenshot utility!

**Raja Rao DV ‚Äî [Why Redux need reducers to be ‚Äúpure functions‚Äù](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-redux-needs-reducers-to-be-pure-functions-d438c58ae468/)**<br />
Redux, as a library, only works if the reducers are pure. What does that mean? Why doesn't it work otherwise? What are the benefits of writing pure functions in Javascript? This article is concisely answering all these questions (thanks [Aurore](https://twitter.com/AuroreMa27) for tweeting it! üôÇ)

**InVision team ‚Äî [Design Better Books](https://www.designbetter.co/books)**<br />
The folks behind InVision (a design tool similar to Zepelin) wrote up a series of three (!) free (!!) ebooks on Product Design. If you want to learn the basics or deepen your knowledge, dive in! (Plus the website is _awesome_ üò¶)

## Libraries

**[ZEIT.co docs](https://github.com/zeit/docs)**<br />
ZEIT, of Hyper.sh, now.sh and next.js fame, launched the new, gorgeous version of their documentation. I encourage you to browse it to get a gist of how clean and clear it is. Plus, they open sourced their documentation engine, so that you can build the same for your Open Source project!
