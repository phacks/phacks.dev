## Talks

**Anjana Vakil — [Immutable data structures for functional JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo0qiGPSV-s)**
At this year’s JSConf.EU, [Anjana Vakil](https://twitter.com/anjanavakil) talked about immutability and functional programming, how it works behind the scenes, and what it means for the Javascript codebases and web apps we build.

## Articles

**James K Nelson — [How can I use CSS-in-JS securely?](https://reactarmory.com/answers/how-can-i-use-css-in-js-securely)**<br />
CSS-in-JS libraries took over the React ecosystem by storm. The flexibility and practicality of using tools like [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) or [Glamorous](https://glamorous.rocks/) for managing the styles of React components is now a given. Although, [as a wise man once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5d6rTQcU2U&feature=youtu.be), “With great power come great responsibilities”: CSS-in-JS comes with its lot of potential security flaws. So read on, and don’t forget to _never trust user input_.

**Tobias Koppers — [Advanced Frontend Optimization (with Webpack)](http://sokra.github.io/slides/frontend-optimize/)**<br />
Although not a proper article, this impressive slide deck is a gold mine for fine-tuning Webpack configurations for performance. Tree shaking, Code Splitting, inlining, Server Side Rendering, you name it, it’s all there!

**Henrik Joreteg — [Betting on the Web](https://joreteg.com/blog/betting-on-the-web)**<br />
The team at Starbucks just released a [preview](https://twitter.com/davidbrunelle/status/905931990444244995) of their upcoming PWA. One of the dev in the team reflects on the Web as a future-proof platform, and how PWAs will (possibly) become the new go-to platform, leaving native apps behind. Interesting and optimistic piece about what what the future of the Web (and IOT, and mobile) may well be!

**David Robinson — [The Incredible Growth of Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/)**<br />
Stack Overflow reflects on the incredible growth of Python, based on their (tremendous) data. As a developer, it’s always interesting to have a look at global trends on languages or frameworks.

## Libraries

**[Electron Webpack Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/electron-webpack-dashboard)**<br />
Want to feel like you’re working at NASA while having a look at your build process? Want to impress your colleagues with a shiny, Minority Report-like dashboard while keeping in check your bundle size? Who would’t — I mean, look at this:
