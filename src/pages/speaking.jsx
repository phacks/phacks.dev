    I believe that speaking at meetups and conferences is a very formative experience, a perfect occasion to make friends and have meaningful discussions with people throughout the community.
    <br /><br />
    However, securing a talk at a meetup or a conference can be way harder for people in under-represented and marginalized communities.
    <br /><br />
    If you feel like this applies to you, I would gladly help you on securing your next talk (help writing your proposal, rehearsingâ€¦). Just contact me (links are in the <a href="/about" class="text-teal-500 hover:underline">About page</a>) and weâ€™ll figure out how to best make it happen!
